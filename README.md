MeetupEventWinners
==================

Getting a list of winners from participants of the specific Meetup event.
A small consol application to simpliy the process of choosing winner from the crowd of participants.
We connect via REST to the Meetup.com API and searches for the specific event (determined by the given/current date) in a given group.
